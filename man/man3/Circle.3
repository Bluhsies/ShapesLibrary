.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This is the \fBCircle\fP class\&. This includes the basic constructor, overloaded constructor to take the position of the \fBCircle\fP when drawn to the screen and the overridden draw function, which is used to draw the shape itself to the screen, once an object has been created in the main function to do so\&. This class also includes access to the public functions (or protected) from the \fBCircularData\fP class, which includes the value for pi, theta and radian value\&.

.PP
Constructor\&. Constructor to take basic values to be overwritten\&. 
.SS "Circle::Circle (sf::Vector2f p1, float p2, sf::Color c1)"

.PP
Overloaded constructor\&. Overloaded constructor to take the central point of the circle, the size of the circle, color, the size of the vertex arrayand the radian value to be passed back to the \fBCircularData\fP class\&. The For loop will increment by 1 each time a line has been drawn and draw the next line until the conditions have been met, ie, the For loop has gotten to 60\&. It will also apply the selected colour to each line\&. It will then draw one final line to connect the circle\&.

Instantiated draw function\&. Instantiated draw function to draw the shape to the screen\&.
